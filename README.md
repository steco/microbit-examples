# Sample micro:bit programs

This repository contains a set of example Javascript programs for the [micro:bit](http://microbit.org/) device.

The micro:bit is a small programmable computer, primarily used in schools to teach children to code.

The programs can be cut-and-pasted directly into Microsoft's [JavaScript Blocks Editor](https://makecode.microbit.org/#)
